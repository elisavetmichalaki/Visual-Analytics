#Visual Analytics

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of global CO₂ emissions data using the dataset from Our World in Data (OWID).
The goal is to analyze patterns, trends, and distributions in CO₂ emissions across G20 countries, providing meaningful insights into their historical and comparative contributions to global emissions.

The dataset can be found here:
